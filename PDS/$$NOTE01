Note from Sam Golob....   (04JUL2016)

As of now, this program will only detect older COBOL versions, and it
needs to be fixed to detect later versions of COBOL.  I ran it against
old ANSI COBOL load modules, and new COBOL modules, and I determied
(it didn't take much) that this program needs to be modernized.

It does (accurately) tell you what CSECTs are in each load module.

There are other programs on the CBT Tape (for example COBANAL on File
321) which will detect attributes of COBOL load modules.  For now you
should use them.

We'll see what we can do in the future with this one.

Sincerely,    Sam Golob
